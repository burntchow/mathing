Hello traveler! ðŸ‘‹

If you've stumbled upon this small project you are very welcome here. Have some snacks ðŸ¥¨ and a seat ðŸª‘.

## Description
When I was but a small bean my arithmetic skills needed some sharpening. Back then I was able to practice online with some mathy games that tricked you into becoming smarter. This isn't as cool, but I wanted to stretch my HTML legs and make something semi useful!

Users can select what operation they want and they have 2 minutes to solve as many questions as they can - quite simple.
